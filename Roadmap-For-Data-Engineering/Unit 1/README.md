## Unit 1: Introduction to Data Engineering (4 hours)

### 📚 Overview of data engineering and its role in data-driven organizations

In this unit, we will introduce the concept of data engineering and its importance in data-driven organizations. We will cover the following topics:

- The definition of data engineering and its role in the data lifecycle
- The difference between data engineering and data science
- The benefits of data engineering for businesses and organizations

### 🚀 Introduction to the data engineering pipeline

In this section, we will discuss the data engineering pipeline and its stages. We will cover the following topics:

- The stages of the data engineering pipeline, including data ingestion, data processing, and data storage
- The tools and technologies used in each stage of the pipeline
- The importance of data quality and data validation in the pipeline

### 🛠️ Common tools and technologies used in data engineering

In this section, we will discuss the common tools and technologies used in data engineering. We will cover the following topics:

- Data storage technologies, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and data lakes
- Data processing technologies, such as Hadoop, Spark, and Flink
- Data integration and ETL tools, such as Apache Nifi, Talend, and Airflow

### 💻 Hands-on practice

In this unit, students will get hands-on experience with the data engineering pipeline and the tools and technologies used in each stage. They will learn how to ingest data from various sources, process and transform data using Apache Spark, and store data in a relational database.

### 📝 Summary

By the end of this unit, students should have a solid understanding of data engineering and its role in data-driven organizations. They should also have a good grasp of the data engineering pipeline and the common tools and technologies used in data engineering. They should be able to perform basic data engineering tasks such as data ingestion, processing, and storage.
