## Unit 7: Capstone Project (4 hours)

In the capstone project, students will have the opportunity to apply the skills learned throughout the course to complete a real-world data engineering project. The goal is to develop a data engineering solution for a real-world business problem or application, such as building a data pipeline for a social media platform or creating a real-time dashboard for monitoring website traffic.

This unit will consist of four hours of project work, during which students will work independently or in groups to develop their projects. They will be provided with guidance and support from the instructor, who will be available to answer questions and provide feedback.

At the end of the project, students will be expected to present their solutions to the class and receive feedback from their peers. This will be an opportunity for students to showcase their skills and receive constructive criticism from their colleagues.

Overall, the capstone project is designed to give students a chance to apply the concepts and techniques they have learned throughout the course to a real-world problem, and to demonstrate their ability to work independently and collaboratively on a data engineering project.
