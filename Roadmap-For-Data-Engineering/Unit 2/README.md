## Unit 2: Relational Databases (8 hours)

### 📚 Introduction to SQL and relational databases

In this unit, we will introduce SQL and relational databases, and their importance in data engineering. We will cover the following topics:

- The basics of SQL and its role in managing data in a relational database
- The advantages of using a relational database over other data storage technologies
- The components of a relational database, including tables, columns, and relationships

### 🏗️ Creating tables and defining relationships

In this section, we will discuss how to create tables and define relationships in a relational database. We will cover the following topics:

- The syntax for creating tables in SQL
- The different types of data that can be stored in a table, including string, numeric, and date/time data
- The syntax for defining relationships between tables, including primary and foreign keys

### 🗃️ Data modeling and normalization

In this section, we will discuss the principles of data modeling and normalization in relational databases. We will cover the following topics:

- The different types of relationships between tables, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships
- The process of normalizing a database to eliminate redundancy and improve performance
- The different normal forms, including first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), and third normal form (3NF)

### 💻 Hands-on practice with SQL and a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL

In this section, students will get hands-on experience with SQL and a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. They will learn how to create tables, define relationships, and query data using SQL.

### 📝 Project: Design and implement a database for a simple web application using SQL and an RDBMS.

In this project, students will apply the concepts and skills they learned in the unit to design and implement a database for a simple web application using SQL and an RDBMS. They will create tables, define relationships, and write queries to retrieve and manipulate data.

### 📊 Using SQL for data analysis

In this section, we will discuss how to use SQL for data analysis and reporting. We will cover the following topics:

- The basics of data analysis using SQL, including aggregations, filtering, and grouping
- How to write complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data
- How to use SQL for reporting and visualizing data

### 📝 Summary

By the end of this unit, students should have a solid understanding of SQL and relational databases, including how to create tables, define relationships, and query data using SQL. They should also understand the principles of data modeling and normalization, and how to apply them to design and implement a database for a simple web application. They should be able to use SQL for basic data analysis and reporting.
