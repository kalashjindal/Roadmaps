## Unit 6: Data Streaming and Real-Time Analytics (4 hours)

### 📚 Introduction to data streaming and real-time analytics

In this unit, we will cover the basics of data streaming and real-time analytics. We will discuss the importance of real-time data processing in today's data-driven world and how it differs from batch processing.

### 🛠️ Overview of Apache Kafka and other data streaming technologies

We will also introduce Apache Kafka, an open-source distributed streaming platform, and other popular data streaming technologies such as Apache Flink and Apache Storm. We will discuss the features, benefits, and use cases of these technologies.

### 💻 Hands-on practice with processing streaming data using Kafka and other tools

You will gain hands-on experience with processing streaming data using Kafka and other tools such as Kafka Connect and Kafka Streams. You will learn how to create producers and consumers, set up topics and partitions, and handle data serialization and deserialization.

### 📝 Project: Build a real-time data processing pipeline using Kafka.

In the project for this unit, you will design and implement a real-time data processing pipeline using Kafka. You will use Kafka Connect to ingest data from a source, perform transformations using Kafka Streams, and output the results to a sink. You will also learn how to monitor and troubleshoot your Kafka cluster and pipeline.
