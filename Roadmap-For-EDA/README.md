📚 **Course Title:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

📌 **Course Description:**
This course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python programming language. Students will learn to analyze, visualize, and interpret data using popular Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The course consists of four major projects, providing hands-on experience in applying EDA techniques to real-world datasets.
