📚 **Course Title:** Mastering SQL: A Comprehensive Course

📌 **Course Description:**
This course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of Structured Query Language (SQL), a powerful language for working with relational databases. Students will learn how to create, query, and manage databases using SQL. The course consists of four major projects, providing hands-on experience in applying SQL techniques to real-world datasets.

- Overview of relational databases and SQL
- Setting up the SQL environment (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Understanding tables, rows, columns, and data types
- Basic SQL syntax and commands

🔹 **Part 2: Data Retrieval with SQL**
- SELECT statement: selecting, filtering, and sorting data
- Combining conditions with AND, OR, and NOT
- Aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX
- GROUP BY and HAVING clauses for grouping and filtering

🔹 **Part 3: Data Manipulation and Modification**
