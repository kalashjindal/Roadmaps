📚 **Course Title:** Spark SQL: A Comprehensive Course

📌 **Course Description:**
This course introduces students to Spark SQL, the module for structured data processing in Apache Spark. Students will learn to use Spark SQL to query and analyze data using SQL and DataFrames, as well as to process data in a distributed and scalable manner. The course covers data loading, querying, transformation, and optimization techniques. Hands-on projects provide practical experience working with real-world datasets.
